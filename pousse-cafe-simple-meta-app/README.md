# Introduction

Pousse-Café is a framework assisting you in writing applications following Domain Driven Design methodology. While DDD
has proven to be useful in writing code representing complex business rules and/or having strong scalability requirements,
it is not always easy to apply given the number of transversal issues that need to be addressed. Pousse-Café's purpose
is to solve most of those issues allowing developers to focus on the Domain and its implementation.

This project is describes a simple meta-app that is used to generate related archetype.
